    "# 1.First, we start with a dataset that has a set of features (variables) and a binary target variable that we want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.The decision tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data into two subsets based on the values of the input features.

    "\n",
    "# 3.At each step, the algorithm splits the data into two subsets, one for each possible value of the selected feature. For example, if the feature is age and the possible values are above or below 30, the algorithm will create two subsets, one for instances where age is above 30 and another for instances where age is below 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.The algorithm continues to select the best feature to split the data and recursively partition the data into subsets until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth, a minimum number of instances in a leaf node, or when all instances in a subset belong to the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Once the decision tree has been constructed, it can be used to make predictions on new data. To make a prediction for a binary classification problem, we start at the root node of the tree and traverse down the tree based on the values of the features of the new data. At each node, we choose the branch that corresponds to the value of the feature for the new data. We continue until we reach a leaf node, which corresponds to a predicted class label (either 0 or 1).\n",
